With the release of Firebase, you can now store all sensitive data such as Users’ credentials on firebase database. 

And here, in order to help you, I’ve written an article on [Integrating Firebase database in your Android app](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-real-time-firebase-database-android-app/) to help you implement in your Android App.

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement Firebase database in your Android app and looking for [Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
